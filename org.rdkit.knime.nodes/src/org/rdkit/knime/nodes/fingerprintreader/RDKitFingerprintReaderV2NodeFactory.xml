    <shortDescription>
        Node to read fingerprints from a FPS file into an output table.
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node reads an FPS file with its fingerprint records into a KNIME table.
            The format of the .fps file is mentioned here: https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-5-S1-P36
        </intro>

        <tab name="Options">
            <option name="Input File">
                The location of the FPS file containing fingerprint records.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Read from</b>
                <br/>
                Select a file system which stores the model you want to read. There
                are four default file system options to choose from:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file from your
                        local system.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
                        When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
                        Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
                        A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
                        You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
                        relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
                        When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the two options to use.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol).
                        When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
                        In case it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.
                        Browsing is disabled for this option.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
                you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
                by clicking the
                <b>...</b>
                in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
                <i>Add File System Connection port</i>
                .
                <br />
                Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node.
                The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
                It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
                Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>File/URL</b>
                <br/>
                Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
                required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
                File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
                File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
                description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
                You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
                from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
                Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
                    <li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
                        Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
                        (Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
                </ul>
                <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a
                </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
                <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
            </option>
            <option name="Use IDs from file as row IDs (Requires unique IDs!)">
                Flag to determine, if IDs read from a fingerprint record of the file shall be used as row IDs.
                This will fail, if the FPS file does not contain unique fingerprint IDs. </option>
