    <name>RDKit Functional Group Filter</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Node for filtering set of molecules containing functional groups specified by the user.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	This node can be used for filtering sets of molecules based on named substructures (functional groups based on SMARTS). 
        	Note that the default definitions are constructed to try and define functional groups relevant for reactivity; consequently 
        	groups like -CF3 do not match the halogen pattern.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="RDKit Mol column">It specifies which column contains the set of RDKit molecules.</option>
        <option name="Functional group definition file">
        	File containing functional group definitions. This input is optional. Alternatively you may
        	press "Load Defaults" to use default functional group definitions. Pressing the info button
        	on the very right shows the content of the currently selected definitions incl. all SMARTS
        	that describe the functional groups.
        </option>
        <option name="List of functional group filters">Defines the conditions for filtering molecules.
        	Select the ones that needs to be applied on the molecules. 
        	If no filter pattern is selected, molecules are sent to the matching output table.
        </option>
        <option name="Recording of first non-matching pattern in new column">
        	If checked, an additional column (the name can be specified) containing the first 
        	non-matching pattern is added to the table of failing molecules.
        </option>
