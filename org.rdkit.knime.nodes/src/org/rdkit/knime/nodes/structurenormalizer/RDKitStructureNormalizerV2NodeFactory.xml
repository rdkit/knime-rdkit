    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Checks structures and tries to normalize them, if necessary. Structures that are normalized already
            will appear in the first output table. Structures, which need to be normalized will be corrected
            and also put in the first output table. Information about the normalization is made available as
            bit mask (flags) as well as warning messages. Structures, which cannot be normalized or have been
            normalized causing a certain warning flag that the user wants to treat as error are put in the
            second table (&quot;Failed Molecules&quot;). <br/><br/>
            The following flags and messages are currently used:
            <ul>
            <li>1 - BAD_MOLECULE, Unable to recognize a molecule (ERROR)</li>
            <li>2 - ALIAS_CONVERSION_FAILED, The atom alias conversion failed (ERROR)</li>
            <li>4 - TRANSFORMED, Structure has been transformed</li>
            <li>8 - FRAGMENTS_FOUND, Multiple fragments have been found</li>
            <li>16 - EITHER_WARNING, A wiggly bond has been removed</li>
            <li>32 - STEREO_ERROR, Stereo chemistry is ambiguously defined (ERROR)</li>
            <li>64 - DUBIOUS_STEREO_REMOVED, A stereo bond has been removed</li>
            <li>128 - ATOM_CLASH, There are two atoms or bonds are too close to each other (ERROR)</li>
            <li>256 - ATOM_CHECK_FAILED, The atom environment is not correct(ERROR)</li>
            <li>512 - SIZE_CHECK_FAILED, The molecule is too big (ERROR)</li>
            <li>1024 - RECHARGED, Structure has been recharged</li>
            <li>2048 - STEREO_FORCED_BAD, Structure has failed: Bad stereo chemistry (ERROR)</li>
            <li>4096 - STEREO_TRANSFORMED, Stereo chemistry has been modified</li>
            <li>8192 - TEMPLATE_TRANSFORMED, Structure has been modified using a template</li>

        <tab name="Options">
            <option name="Input - SDF, SMILES or RDKit Mol column">
                The input column with SDF, SMILES or RDKit Molecules. The latter ones are
                treated as SDF values. SMILES input will be converted internally into mol blocks before the normalization
                is done.</option>
            <option name="Passed Output - Corrected structure column name">
                The name of the column that will contain the original or corrected structure,
                in case that any normalization has been applied.</option>
            <option name="Passed Output - Flags column name">
                The name of the column that will contain the warning flags. This is a bit mask
                where each bit has a certain meaning as described above.</option>
            <option name="Passed Output - Warning messages column name">
                The name of the column that will contain the warning messages associated
                with the flags. The &quot;Passed Molecules&quot; table contains only warnings, which
                are usually associated with a normalization of the input structure.</option>
            <option name="Failed Output - Flags column name">
                The name of the column that will contain the error flags. This is a bit mask
                where each bit has a certain meaning as described above.</option>
            <option name="Failed Output - Error messages column name">
                The name of the column that will contain the error messages associated
                with the flags. The &quot;Failed Molecules&quot; table contains only error that
                prevented the normalization of an input structure. Additionally,
                it may contain also warnings that are treated like an error
                on special request of the user (see Advanced tab).</option>
            <option name="Logfile Output (Optional) - Selected File">
                A logfile can be specified here which logs additional output in case
                of normalizations of structures. It can be used for informal
                purposes only. There is no mapping in the logfile that would
                reveal which line belongs to which structures, hence it is only
                useful if not too many structures are processed.
                <br/><br/>
                The "Specify File..." button lets you define your log file in a dialog with the following options:
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Write to</b>
                <br/>
                Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There are four default file system options to
                choose from:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a location in your local system.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to write to a mountpoint. When selected, a new drop-down menu appears
                        to choose the mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that
                        browsing is disabled in this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
                        browsing. A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
                        You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path relative to the current
                        mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area. When selected a new drop-down menu
                        appears to choose which of the three options to use.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol).
                        When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and write timeout
                        in milliseconds. In case it takes longer to connect to the host / write the file, the node fails to
                        execute. Browsing is disabled for this option.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore, you have to enable the file system
                connection input port of this node by clicking the <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node's icon
                and choose <i>Add File System Connection port</i>.
                <br />
                Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node. The file system connection will
                then be shown in the drop-down menu. It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case
                you have to (re)execute the connector node first. Note: The default file systems listed above can't be
                selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>File/URL</b>
                <br/>
                Enter a URL when writing to <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
                required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
                File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
                File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
                description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
                You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
                from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
                Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
                    <li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
                        Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
                        (Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
                </ul>
                <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a
                </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
                <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Create missing folders</b>
                <br/>
                Select if the folders of the selected output location should be created if
                they do not already exist. If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>If exists</b>
                <br/>
                Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already exists.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Overwrite:</i> Will replace any existing file.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Fail:</i> Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
                    </li>
