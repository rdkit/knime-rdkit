/**
 * A safe guarded resource shields a resource from unauthorized thread access.
 * By overriding the method {@link #createResource()} the developer has full
 * freedom to make use of all necessary logic to create an instance of the
 * resource. However, this method is then called on demand. Normally, such a
 * resource shall not be shared between threads. For every thread that is
 * calling the {@link #get()} method, it creates once a new instance of
 * this resource and returns it. Subsequent calls to {@link #get()} result
 * in the very same resource if the same thread is calling. In the special
 * case that the resource could be shared between threads -- this may happen
 * in certain situations -- the {@link #get()} method will always return
 * the same resource. A protected resource can be null, if a) the method
 * {@link #createResource()} returned null, or if b) this object has been
 * disposed (see {@link #delete()}. Subsequent calls to {@link #get()}
 * will always return null. It is recommended to call {@link #delete()} when
 * the resource is not needed anymore to free up references and to help
 * the garbage collector to free heap memory.
